The technical object's of these module are:

1. Explain the structures, interactions, and types of data of a provided dataset.
2. Differentiate between SQLite and PostgreSQL databases.
3. Use SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database.
4. Use statistics like minimum, maximum, and average to analyze data.
5. Design a Flask application using data.

Were we'll be able to see in these challenge's module 2 phases:

- Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June.
- Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December.

### Deliverable 1:
As we can see in our below graphs:

2. * **June Temperature: We have an aprox mean of** _74.04_.

To have a better visualization we present a bar graph of our month tempetures.
As we can see, we have good temperatures during these month, where a month with high audience is projected, due to the excellent weather, the waves are in their maximum brightness, giving us the opportunity to have good profits.

2. * **December Temperature: We have a mean of** _71.04_.

As we can see it's not a high season for our store derived from the weather, the tempeture is not warm, we trully recommend a course of surfing for beginners be opened during these period, to be attractive to the public and have high profits, regardless of the temperature.
